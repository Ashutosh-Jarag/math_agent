1,"Differentiate f(x)=x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x","f'(x)=3x^2 + 4x - 5","1. Write f(x)=x^3+2x^2-5x; 2. Use power rule d(x^n)/dx = n x^{n-1}; 3. derivative of x^3 is 3x^2; 4. derivative of 2x^2 is 4x; 5. derivative of -5x is -5; 6. combine: 3x^2+4x-5","calculus,derivative"
2,"Integrate ∫(2x) dx","x^2 + C","1. Recognize integrand 2x = 2 * x; 2. Use power rule ∫ x^n dx = x^{n+1}/(n+1); 3. ∫ 2x dx = 2 * x^2/2 = x^2; 4. add constant C -> x^2 + C","calculus,integral"
3,"Solve equation 2x + 3 = 11","x = 4","1. Subtract 3 both sides: 2x = 8; 2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4","algebra,linear"
4,"Find area of triangle with base 10 and height 6","Area = 30","1. Formula area = (1/2)*base*height; 2. plug base=10 height=6 -> 0.5*10*6 = 30","geometry,area"
5,"Simplify (x^2 * x^3)","x^5","1. Use exponent rule x^a * x^b = x^{a+b}; 2. x^2 * x^3 = x^{2+3} = x^5","algebra,exponents"
