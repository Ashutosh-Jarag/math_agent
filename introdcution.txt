🔸 2. LinkedIn / GitHub Description (medium-length)

Math Agent is an AI-powered web application that provides step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems using Google Gemini API for reasoning and Qdrant for knowledge retrieval.
It uses a hybrid approach — first searching a vectorized knowledge base for similar problems, then using AI generation when needed, and continuously improves through user feedback retraining.

The system features:

🧮 Math-only guardrails for safe, relevant responses

⚡ FastAPI backend integrated with Gemini and Qdrant

🌐 React + Tailwind frontend for smooth UX

🔁 Feedback loop that enhances performance over time

Tech Stack: FastAPI, React, Qdrant, Gemini API, Python, TailwindCSS, Docker

Perfect for your LinkedIn “Projects” section or GitHub README intro.

🔷 3. Detailed Portfolio / Report Description

Project Title: AI-Powered Math Agent

The Math Agent is an advanced AI-driven web application designed to assist students and professionals with mathematical problem-solving. It leverages Google Gemini’s generative reasoning capabilities to produce step-by-step explanations for calculus, algebra, and matrix operations.

The backend, built with FastAPI, integrates a Qdrant Vector Database for semantic retrieval — allowing the system to fetch similar solved examples from a custom knowledge base (KB). When no close match exists, the system performs web search augmentation via the Serper API and generates answers contextually.

A feedback module allows users to rate AI answers and contribute corrections, which are later processed by an automated retraining pipeline that expands the vector knowledge base.

The frontend, built in React with TailwindCSS, offers an intuitive interface for asking questions, viewing AI-generated solutions, and submitting feedback.

Key Functionalities:

Step-by-step mathematical problem solving

Knowledge base retrieval using vector similarity (Qdrant)

AI reasoning and explanation via Gemini API

User feedback with automatic KB retraining

Input/output guardrails ensuring safe and math-focused interaction

Dockerized deployment for scalability

Tech Stack:

Backend: FastAPI, Python, Qdrant, Google Gemini API, Serper API

Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS, Vite

Infrastructure: Docker, Uvicorn

Outcome:
Achieved a robust, self-learning AI math assistant capable of producing accurate, structured, and pedagogical solutions while maintaining domain-specific safety and adaptability.
